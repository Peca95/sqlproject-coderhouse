# sqlproject-coderhouse
Final project of my SQL course.
Thematic: Tellevo is an app that helps users to get around the cities of Nicaragua. It is currently only available in that country, it is a recent app that was launched in May 2022.

I created a database for the easy management of the information in which we include; information of the vehicles, driver and clients. The cities where the app has been used and the record of each trip with all the information from the date, kilometers traveled, driver and customer who requested it.

Keep in mind that drivers are requested not to use more than 1 vehicle.
